# TradeOut

## Description

Conducting transactions in an online marketplace can be risky, and, unfortunately, scams and falsely advertised products are quite common. TradeOut is a platform that gives people greater transaction security by providing a quick and simple way to generate a digital contract between buyer and seller. Whether youâ€™re the buyer or the seller, in TradeOut you can:
- Initiate a contract for a transaction, including uploading item images
- Send the contract to the other party
- Sign the contract once you agree with the terms
- Always access a copy of the final, signed contract
- View all accepted, pending, and declined contracts

## Installation
1. Create a new database named `tradeout`, and execute the queries from `database.sql` to create the needed tables. 
2. Within a code editor, open a terminal window and install the dependencies by running: `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file with values for the following variables:
  ```

4. Run `npm run server` to start the server in one terminal window. Open a second terminal window, and run `npm run client` to start the client. The application will open at `localhost:3000/#/dashboard` in the browser. TradeOut was built and designed for compatibility with Google Chrome.
